# IR-Motion-Sensor
Built an infrared motion detector using an NE555 timer IC for AC load control and an IR sensor module for sensing motion
Some key components of the circuit are a BC547 NPN Transistor which functions as a switch, an op amp for voltage gain, a single pole double throw relay, as well as the NE555 integrated circuit and IR sensor module 
Additionally, LEDs, resistors, wires and capacitors were used
